    <h4>About Alligators</h4>
    <p>
      Alligators, large reptiles with powerful jaws and armored bodies, inhabit
      freshwater habitats like swamps and rivers. They are apex predators,
      relying on stealth to capture prey. Ectothermic, they regulate body
      temperature through sun exposure and water. Despite their fearsome
      reputation, they typically avoid humans but can become aggressive when
      provoked. Conservation efforts have stabilized populations, but habitat
      loss remains a threat. Alligators hold cultural significance and symbolize
      wild, untamed landscapes.
